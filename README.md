### Data analyzed in the manuscript
Fully de-identified raw digital ECG signal is provided within MATLAB .fig files. Fig files contain data matrix, and represent three-dimensional vectorcardiographic loops: QRS and T loops after 7 days of pacing, in AAI and DDD mode. AAI-7 and DDD-7 angles and vectors are plotted.
